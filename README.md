This repository contains the homework for Module 4: Pandas Dataframes.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we created a comprehensive report that analyzes district and school performance metrics. The district summary includes total schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentages of students passing each subject. The school summary provides detailed metrics for each school, and we identified the highest and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing percentages. Additionally, we analyzed scores by grade, spending ranges, school size, and school type, and included written descriptions of some observable trends based on the data.

Class notes, AskBCS Learning Assistant, and tutoring were leveraged to complete the assignment. For instance, it was under the tutor's guidance that I added a column for Per Student Budget Clean so that way I could use the data free of formatting later on in the code when I was sorting the data into bins. It was the Learning Assistant who directed me to the .agg function when calculating the mean average/% passing math/reading scores and % overall passing grouped by school size. I then leveraged the .agg function in later instances in the same way. I added the "observed=False" as directed by the error message displayed when trying to print.
